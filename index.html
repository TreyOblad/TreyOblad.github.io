  <H1>Was That An Accident Or Not?</H1>
    <p>
    Was that an accident or not?<br>
    I accidently smashed a pot.<br>
    I don't know why I killed a fly and flushed down some porcupine snot.<br>
    After I flushed down the snot I knew that I had to flee.<br>
    Because in the toilet there was a bee that was about to come out and sting me!<br>
